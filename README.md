# SYSC2004 - Turn-Based Battle Game

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

### Project Overview

This project, titled "Siege," is a turn-based battle game developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Inspired by Ubisoft’s Rainbow Six Siege (2015), the game immerses players in strategic turn-based battles featuring a dynamic set of Soldiers/Operators categorized as Attackers and Defenders.

## Game Details

- **Game Title:** Siege
- **Game Category:** Turn-Based Shooting Style
- **Inspiration:** Ubisoft’s Rainbow Six Siege (2015)

### Game Mechanics

In Siege, players engage in turn-based battles with 4 Attackers and 4 Defenders. Each Soldier has distinct abilities:

#### Soldier Abilities:

- **Attacking Modes:**
  - Shooting with a primary gun
  - Shooting with a secondary gun (randomized during the attacking phase)

- **Special Attacks:**
  - Attackers have unique special attacks (usable once)
  - Defenders have a special ability to boost health by 30 (usable once)

- **Health and Armor:**
  - Soldiers have Health Points (HP) and armor.
  - When attacked, there's a chance to target either HP or armor.
  - Note: Defenders have a second layer of armor.

#### Goal:

The objective is to deplete the opponent's HP. If HP reaches 0, even with active armor, the player loses.

#### Attacker Characteristics:

- Higher firepower than Defenders
- Primary and secondary guns deal more damage
- Special attack available
- Higher chance to attack with the primary gun
- Lower armor than Defenders
- Higher chance to have HP targeted instead of armor

#### Defender Characteristics:

- Lower firepower than Attackers
- Less chance to attack with the main gun
- Special ability to heal
- Higher armor than Attackers, including a second armor layer
- More chance to take hits on armor than directly on Health Points

### Project Features

This turn-based battle game incorporates strategic choices, unique abilities, and distinct characteristics for Attackers and Defenders, creating a dynamic and engaging gaming experience.
